				<p>
					I was born on August 3, 2004, in Barit, Candaba, Pampanga,
					Philippines, as the third of four siblings. Growing up in a close-knit
					family, I learned the value of love, resilience, and supporting one
					another through life's ups and downs.
				</p>
				<p>
					My life motto, "Que sera, sera" (Whatever will be, will be), inspires
					me to stay positive and embrace whatever life brings, whether it's
					good or challenging.
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently, I am a third-year Bachelor of Science in Information
					Technology student at National University - Baliwag, specializing in
					Mobile and Web Application Development. I am passionate about
					continuous learning and enjoy working on simple yet impactful projects
					that focus on functionality and purpose.
